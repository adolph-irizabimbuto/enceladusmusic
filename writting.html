            It's ironic that in this increasingly anonymous age of modern technology we have regressed back to a Neanderthal mindset, since leaving thinly veiled "comments" on Instagram pictures on the guises of "interaction" has become the social norm. id argue that social interactions died the day we validated, vouched, verified, vindicated and gauged the veritableness everything on social media platforms. 
            <br><br>
            I understand that it's in our nature to gravitate towards confirmation bias and sensationalism, but it takes a force of will to reject the need to conform to this social construct and to resist the urge to publicise every aspect of our lives. It is necessary to reduce the number of hours we spend on these platforms as it's crucial to long term happiness. Social Media exists at the nexus of loneliness and depression, and our over indulgence of it only makes it worse.
            <br><br>
            The creators of these platforms take advantage of our need to belong which is an involuntary, instinctive and visceral reaction that is deep-rooted in human nature. Until we come to terms with the fact that us, the users, are to blame for the adverse effects of social media then nothing is going to change, and certainly not overnight. As humans, if we take a step back and think retrospectively and conscientiously then it wouldn't  take long to surmise that social media incites and echoes the notions of “survival of the fittest” and encourages dishonesty, deceit and perpetual pretentiousness. 
            <br><br>
            We need to take an introspective step back to re-examine ourselves, to re-discover who we truly are and not how the world sees us or how we present ourselves on the platforms. Social Media is deceptively effective at giving us what we yearn for, which is an identity, but regardless of how sophomoric it may seem on the surface I honestly believe that the hardest thing for any one person to know is themselves and social media only complicates that already complex, perplexing and arduous journey.

            Fremantle is the best suburb in Perth, actually no, in AUSTRALIA, here’s why:
            <br><br>
            Theres a theory called “Dickman’s 5 A’'s” , it suggests that a tourist destination  needs to fulfil the 5 A’s (Access, Accomodation, Amenities, Activities, and Attractions) to be sensible and sustainable. I preface my argument with this mainly as a referencing point to reinforce my argument. (see referenced journal article below)
            <br><br>
            Fremantles’ strength is its attractions and although they may not be as world famous as the The Sydney Opera House or the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the offer something unique that the aforementioned destinations lack, they are a rare blend of historical heritage, a cross between the the 21st Century Australia and the Victorian 19th Century.
            <br><br>
            Fremantle is a secret sensation, a seaside gem, an architectural masterpiece that even Antoni Gaudi would be astounded by, because it is mesmerising in its layout, misleading in its simplicity and magnetising in its beauty, a beauty that perpetually remains unchanged. With that said Fremantle still doesn’t feel like lit was built solely for attracting tourists, (although  its awe inspiring design made that inevitable) 
            <br><br>
            Fremantle feels like what Fremantle is, a backdrop to the best preserved 19th century port street scape in the world, an electric and eccentric blend of fabulous artisanal food, handcrafted beers, great coffee, quirky boutiques, pristine turquoise beaches and a fresh sea breeze.
